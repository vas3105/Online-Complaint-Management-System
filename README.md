# Online-Complaint-Management-System
This is a simple web-based platform that allows students to register and manage complaints related to college facilities such as hostels, classrooms, and administration. The system provides a structured way for users to submit issues and for administrators to view, track, and mark complaints as resolved. This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL to build a responsive and user-friendly interface with efficient data handling. It aims to reduce manual record-keeping, improve transparency, and ensure faster resolution of complaints.
